# Milestone 5

# General information
This project investigates how the use of slang in English literature has changed between 1980 and 2010, using Project Gutenberg. Through text analysis, this research wants to discover patterns and trends in how slang has been incorporated into books, reflecting linguistic and cultural changes.

# Background information
A few studies have researched use of slang in different time periods:

Interrelationships between language and literature from old English to the modern period - Zare Behtash Esmail

Twentieth century English literature - Harry Blamires

# Research questions and hypothesis
My research question is: How has the use of slang in English literature changed between 1980 and 2010?

My hypothesis for this question is that the frequency and variety of slang terms increase in English literature in 2010.

# Method
Project Gutenberg will be used during this research. I will try to find one author that wrote books in both time periods, otherwise I will use books in the same genre and authors who might have similar writing styles or backgrounds. I will define which slang words I'll be using in the research, this will differ per time per time period. 

The goal of this research will be to provide a detailed account of the evolution of slang in literature and with that finding out if there is a connection between linguistic changes and cultural changes.
