# Milestone 5

# General information
This project investigates how the use of slang in English literature has changed in the years 1886 and 1911, using Project Gutenberg. Through text analysis, this research wants to discover patterns and trends in how slang has been incorporated into books, reflecting linguistic and cultural changes.

The goal of this research will be to provide a detailed account of the evolution of slang in literature and with that finding out if there is a connection between linguistic changes and cultural changes.

# Background information
A few studies have researched use of slang in different time periods:

Interrelationships between language and literature from old English to the modern period - Zare Behtash Esmail

Twentieth century English literature - Harry Blamires

# Research questions and hypothesis
Research question: How has the use of slang in English literature changed between 1886 and 1911?

My hypothesis for this question is that the variety of slang terms increase in English literature in 2010.

# Method
Project Gutenberg will be used during this research. I will try to find one author that wrote books in both time periods, for this I have chosen the author Frances Hodgson Burnett's Little Lord Faunteroy (1886) and The Secret Garden (1911). I will define which slang words I'll be using in the research, this will differ per time per time period.
